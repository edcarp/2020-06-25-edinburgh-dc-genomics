Notes on workshop timings for the 2020-06-25-edinburgh-dc-genomics workshop. In particular for trading off between Lesson 1 [Project Organization and Management](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/) and Lesson 2 [Introduction to the Command Line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/).

Goal is to have realistic *clock* timings for day 1.

### Etherpad notes for silent collaborative-doc'ing

Project Organisation and Management for Genomics

#### Discussion 1 (silent collaborative document) 

- **What's your name?** What kind of sequencing data are you collecting? What question is your experiment answering? What kinds of data and information have you generated before you sent your DNA/RNA off for sequencing?

Example

- **Edward:** CLIP-seq/CRAC. Asking which RNA is bound by my yeast protein (Ssd1) and how that changes as cells grow. Have data on cell growth (timepoints and optical density) in text format...

#### Discussion 2: Problems with spreadsheet data.

#### Discussion 3: Working with sequence data

#### Discussion 4: Sample submission sheet

#### Discussion 5: Getting data back from the facility

#### Discussion 6: Review the SraRunTable
