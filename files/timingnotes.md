Notes on workshop timings for the 2020-06-25-edinburgh-dc-genomics workshop. In particular for trading off between Lesson 1 [Project Organization and Management](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/) and Lesson 2 [Introduction to the Command Line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/).
